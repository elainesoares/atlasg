        <p>Human development is the process of expanding people's freedoms – in terms of the capabilities and opportunities at their disposal - so they may choose what kind of life they wish to lead.</p>
        <p>The process of expanding freedoms includes the necessary social, economic, political and environmental dynamics to ensure a variety of opportunities are available for the population, as well as a favourable environment for each person to exercise their potential to the fullest.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Human Development must be focused on people and improving their well-being. It should not to be understood as the accumulation of wealth and the growth of income, but rather as the expansion of the range of choices and skills and the freedom to choose. In this approach, income and wealth are not ends in themselves, but a means so that people may choose how they wish to lead their lives.</p>
        <p>The economic growth of a society does not automatically entail better quality of life; instead, what is often seen is an increase in inequalities. This growth must be transformed into concrete achievements for the people, such as: improvements in the health of children, universal and quality education, greater political participation by citizens, environmental preservation, a steady income and opportunities for the entire population, among other factors, to ensure greater freedom of expression.Therefore, by placing the people at the heart of the well-being analysis, the human development approach redefines the ways we think and deal with development - nationally and locally.</p>
        <p>The concept of human development, as well as its measure - the Human Development Index - HDI, were first presented in 1990, in the first Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme, created by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq, in collaboration with - and under the inspiration of the thoughts of - economist Amartya Sen.</p>
        <p>The popularisation of the human development approach occurred during the process of creating and adopting the HDI as a measure of the degree of Human Development in a given country, as an alternative to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which was the hegemonic development measurement at the time.</p>
        <p>The HDI combines three of the most important requirements for the extension of people's freedoms: the opportunity to lead a long and healthy life - health - to have access to knowledge - education - and to be able to have a decent standard of living - income.</p>
        <p>Mainly due to the fact that it is simple, easy to understand, and more holistic and comprehensive, the HDI has had a worldwide repercussion. By transforming the complexity of three important dimensions into a single number, the HDI has become a way of understanding and promoting a wide discussion and reflection on the meaning of human development for society.</p>

            <span ><b>A LONG AND HEALTHY LIFE (Longevity)</b></span><br />
            Leading a long and healthy life is key to a full life. Promoting human development requires the extension of people’s opportunities, so that a healthy environment is ensured and premature deaths are avoided; there should be access to quality health care, so that the population can achieve the highest possible standard of physical and mental health.

            <span><b>ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE (Education)</b></span><br />
            Access to knowledge is crucial for well-being and essential to the exercise of individual freedoms, autonomy and self-esteem. Education is the key to extending people’s skills so that they can decide on their own future. Education builds confidence, provides dignity, and broadens the horizons and perspectives of people's lives.

            <span><b>STANDARD OF LIVING (Income)</b></span><br />
            Income is essential in tending to basic needs such as water, food and shelter, but also in being able to transcend these needs, towards a life of genuine choices and the exercise of freedom. Income is an instrument for a number of purposes: it enables people to choose from available alternatives and the absence of it may limit life's opportunities.
