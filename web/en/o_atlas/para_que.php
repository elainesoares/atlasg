    <div id="texto_paraque">
        <p>The objective of Atlas Brazil 2013 is to provide tools for Brazilian society by disseminating knowledge and increasing awareness about the realities citizens live in. Making municipal information more democratically-accessible strengths local capacities, improves public management and empowers Brazilian citizens.</p>
        <p>The Atlas aims to consolidate a well-grounded development dialogue from a reference used internationally - the Human Development Index (HDI). It is a tool that encourages people to use socioeconomic data for analysing our society.</p>
        <p>Besides the fact that Atlas 2013 brings transparency to the development processes, it also helps track the paths taken by municipalities in recent decades and, thus, gives us an essential foundation for outlining the future.</p>

            <p><b>State and federal managers</b> For managers of federal and state policies, the Atlas is a concise way to identify areas that need the intervention of programmes, sectoral and territorial policies and specific actions.</p>
            <p><b>Municipal players </b> The Atlas provides both the public administration and local civil society with support to diagnose major municipal challenges, providing tools to officers and expanding the space for participation by society at large.</p>
            <p><b>Researchers</b> The comparative analysis of the municipal contexts and their evolution throughout the years - through selected indicators - contribute public policy studies to identify successful programmes and replicable experiences, as well as to map out territorial challenges and opportunities.</p>
            <p><b>Civil society and the private sector</b> The Atlas guides civil society and the private sector in their activities towards Brazilian development, including allocating resources and defining the target audience and the initiatives.</p>
            <p><b>Citizens</b> Access to clear and concise information encourages social participation which, in turn, makes Brazilian citizens increasingly greater protagonists in their realities and futures.</p>
