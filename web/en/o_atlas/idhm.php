        <p>In 2012, UNDP Brazil, the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) and the João Pinheiro Foundation (FJP) undertook the challenge of adapting the global HDI methodology to calculate a municipal HDI (MHDI) of the 5,565 Brazilian municipalities, using data from Demographic Census 2010. Also, the MHDI of the years 1991 and 2000 was re-calculated with the adopted methodology, in order to match the municipal information of the years 1991, 2000 and 2010 – taking into account the administrative divisions in the period and allowing spatial and temporal comparison between the municipalities.<p/>
        <p>The Brazilian MHDI has the same three dimensions as the global HDI - longevity, education and income -, but MHDI goes further with matching the global methodology to the Brazilian context with available national indicators. Even though the indices measure the same phenomena, the indicators taken into account in MHDI are more suitable when evaluating the development of the Brazilian municipalities. </p> 
        <p>Thus, with its three components - MHDI Longevity, MHDI Education, MHDI Income – the MHDI tells a bit of the history of the Brazilian municipalities in three important dimensions of human development over the recent decades.</p>
        <p>The MHDI is accompanied by more than 180 socioeconomic indicators that support the MHDI analysis and extend the understanding of the phenomena and dynamics the municipal development is facing. The MHDI and the supportive indicators are brought together in the Atlas of Human Development in Brazil 2013.</p>

            <span ><b>COUNTERPOINT TO GDP</b></span><br />
            The MHDI popularizes the concept of people-centered development instead of the view that development means just economic growth.

            <span><b>COMPARISON BETWEEN MUNICIPALITIES</b></span><br />
            With its three components the MHDI enables comparison between municipalities over time by synthesizing a complex reality into a single number.

            The MHDI ranking encourages the implementers and makers of public policies at the municipal level to prioritize the improvement of people's lives in their actions and decisions.

            <p><b>Long and healthy life </b> is measured by the life expectancy at birth and calculated by the indirect method and using data from the Demographic Census of The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This indicator shows the average number of years that a person born in a particular municipality live from birth maintaining the same mortality patterns.
            </p>
            
            <br />
            <p><b>Access to knowledge </b>is measured by two indicators. The level of education of the adult population is measured by the percentage of people aged 18 years or older having primary education completed – with a weight of 1. The educational flow of young people is measured by the arithmetic mean of the percentage of children aged 5 to 6 years attending school, the percentage of young people aged 11 to 13 years attending the final years of primary education, the percentage of young people aged 15 to 17 years having completed primary education and the percentage of young people aged 18 to 20 years having completed secondary education –weight of 2. The measurement follows the school-age population at four important moments of their educational lives. This makes it easier for managers to identify whether the children and young people are in suitable grades at certain ages. The MHDI Education is a result of the geometric mean of these two components. The used data is collected via demographic census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

            <br />
            <p><b>Standard of living </b> is measured by the municipal income <i>per capita</i>; in other words, by the average income of a resident of a certain municipality. It is the sum of the income of all residents, divided by the number of people living in the municipality – including children and people who are registered without income. The applied data was collated by the Demographic Censuses conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).</p>

        The MHDI is a number between 0 and 1. The closer it is to 1, the higher the level of human development in the municipality.

            In the global Human Development Report 2013, UNDP introduced the HDI of 187 countries and territories. The methodology applied to the global HDI in 2013 contains four variables:
        </div>
        <div id="column" style="margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 126px;">
            In health, the variable is life expectancy at birth. In education, it is the combination of two variables - average years of education of the population aged 25 years or older and the expected years of education. In income, the variable is the Gross National Income (GNI) <i>per capita</i>.
        </div>
        <div id="column" style='margin-top: 126px;'>
            In the global HDI of HDR 2013, the three dimensions have the same weight - the means being geometric - the levels of human development of the countries are defined every year depending on the HDIs observed, and divided into categories of Low, Medium, High and Very High Human Development.
